## Synopsis
Assignment of Fundamentals of Programming COMP5005

## Contents
README - readme file for assignment.
cano.py - module of files for canopy simulations, modified based on the version of my outcome of PracTest3.
utils.py - utils to handle files/colours/file content/prompt.
plots.py - plots.py - entrance of main program, to invoke all the methods to generate the map,
     including RGB view (3d) and thermal view (2d).
files in 'test' folder - tests for main program
    testCano.py - testing for cano.py.
files in 'shell' folder - shell scripts to automate the demonstration.
    config_file_continuous_temperature.sh - continuous changing temperature scenario, run with config file
    config_file_high_temperature.sh - high fixed temperature scenario, run with config file
    config_file_low_temperature.sh - low fixed temperature scenario, run with config file
    prompt_continuous_temperature.sh - continuous changing temperature scenario, run with prompt
    prompt_high_temperature.sh - high fixed temperature scenario, run with prompt
    prompt_high_temperature.sh - high fixed temperature scenario, run with prompt
files in 'config' folder - configuration files
    map_configuration.csv - quantity of blocks in row and column, block size, park percentage, separating with ','.
    temperature_daytime.csv - high fixed temperature; low fixed temperature; temperature over a single day,
     24 hours from 8am to 7am next day
